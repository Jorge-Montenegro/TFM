# Forecast Sale Model

## Briefly description
The idea of this project is forecasting sales in an eComm Business. This type of problems are classified as Time Series and I applied different models in order to compare their performance.

There are two main data files in Excel which have been shared by Email to Dani and Igor.

## Execution

It is quite straightforwad. Firstly, ensure you have installed these libraries in your environment:
* fitter
* xgboost
* lightgbm
* pystan
* fbprophet
* tensorflow
* keras
* streamlit

Ensure all files are located in the same folder. Once you have checked all those requirements, just open this notebook **Forecast_Sale_Model**

## Frontend

If you want to see this project running, just execute **streamlit run visualization.py**
